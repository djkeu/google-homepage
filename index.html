            Can you believe it, I don't have to refresh the page to see the changes.<br />
            In theory, that is. Nothing's happening.

            Yep, that's how it works. That information wasn't shown in the YT-video about setting up Live Server on the Odin Project, found it in another video about Live Server with an actual voice explaining what needs to be done to get it to work instead of playing a musical loop that doesn't do anything but destroy my concentration.

            Ah, wordwrap's working now, thank you VSCode! Don't know why it didn't work before but I'm not going to look for an explanation now. I think I'd better add some style to this page first, it doesn't look very good.

            Never mind, it's just for testing vscode and git now. Gonna change the contents later to make sure it looks a little more like the Google homepage.
