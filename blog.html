            Using the Live Server extension. Can you believe it, I don't have to refresh the page to see the changes.<br />
            In theory, that is. In reality nothing's happening.

            Looks like I still have to save the file before seeing any changes.
            Let me check that again.

            Yep, that's how it works. That information wasn't shown in the YT-video about setting up Live Server on the Odin Project, found it in another video about Live Server with an actual voice explaining what needs to be done to get it to work instead of playing a musical loop that doesn't do anything but destroy my concentration.

            While I'm still being cynical:<br />
            It doesn't seem as handy as a preview, but I guess I'll find good use for it somewhere in the near future when learning to program takes me to places where simple previews don't cut it anymore.<br />

            Ah, wordwrap's working, thank you VSCode! Don't know why it didn't work before but I'm not going to look for an explanation now. I think I'd better add some style to this page first, it doesn't look very good.

            Never mind, it's just for testing vscode and git now. Gonna change the contents later to make sure it looks a little more like the Google homepage.

            Taking a break now. Check the refrigerator for something to eat.

            Started working on the Google-page. The logo is up and so are the search-box and the buttons. Things aren't looking quite as polished as they do on the real Google-site but I'll get to that later. First I'm gonna add the nav-bar, place it in the header and copy it to the footer.

            Got a bit sidetracked the last couple of days, but with good results I think. Finally learned how to share files among two Linux computers with ssh. Did it with some command-line stuff, that's gotta be worth something.
